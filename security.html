    <h3>here we will discuss the different security issues and how to handel them, please take your time to read this section and understand all the issues.</h3><br>
    <div class="top">
    <h4>In preparation for the possibility of an attack:</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Keep all systems and software up-to-date with the latest security patches.</li>
        <li>Implement strong password policies for all user accounts.</li>
        <li>Regularly backup critical data and store it securely offline.</li>
        <li>Deploy an intrusion detection/prevention system (IDS/IPS) to monitor and block suspicious network traffic.</li>
        <li>Enable Windows Firewall and configure it to allow only necessary incoming and outgoing connections.</li>
        <li>Educate employees about social engineering and other common attack vectors.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div class="top">
<br><h4>Abnormal inbound web traffic is detected:</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the Sophos firewall logs for any anomalies in incoming traffic.</li>
        <li>If necessary, block the suspicious IP addresses or ranges identified in the logs.</li>
        <li>Analyze the Windows Event logs for any unusual activity related to web services.</li>
        <li>Run an antivirus/anti-malware scan on all systems to identify and remove potential threats.</li>
    </ul><br>
<div class="top">
    <br><h4>There is evidence your network is under attack from the outside:</h4>
</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Activate incident response procedures immediately.</li>
        <li>Isolate the affected systems from the network to prevent further spread.</li>
        <li>Use Wireshark to capture and analyze the network traffic to identify the attack vector.</li>
        <li>Consult the Sophos firewall logs to determine the source of the attack and block malicious IP addresses.</li>
        <li >Contact your ISP and provide them with evidence of the attack for their assistance.</li>
    </ul>
<div class="top">
    <br><h4>A DOS attack is underway:</h4>
</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Notify your upstream provider and consider utilizing their DOS protection services if available.</li>
        <li>In Sophos firewall, implement rate limiting rules to mitigate the effects of the attack.</li>
        <li>Analyze incoming traffic patterns using Wireshark to identify the source and type of attack.</li>
        <li>Temporarily block the attacking IP addresses using the Sophos firewall.</li>
        <li>Consider distributing traffic using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) if available.
        </li>
    </ul><br>

<div class="top">
    <br><h4>Anomalous activity is detected on the internal network:</h4>
</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further damage.</li>
        <li>Check the Windows Event logs on the affected system for any signs of suspicious activity.</li>
        <li>Use Wireshark to analyze network traffic from the affected system and identify any malicious connections.</li>
        <li>If necessary, implement network segmentation to isolate the compromised system and prevent lateral movement.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <div class="top">
    <br><h4>There is evidence an attacker has gained entry to the network:</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Initiate the incident response plan and assemble the incident response team.</li>
        <li>Use Wireshark to perform packet analysis and identify the point of entry.</li>
        <li>Investigate Windows Event logs for any signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.</li>
        <li>Change all passwords for potentially compromised accounts, including privileged ones.</li>
        <li>Determine the extent of the breach and the data accessed or exfiltrated.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="top">
    <br><h4> An attack has ended:</h4>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Conduct a post-incident review and document all findings for future reference.</li>
        <li>Update and patch any vulnerabilities that were exploited during the attack.</li>
        <li> Assess the effectiveness of the response and make necessary improvements to the incident response plan.</li>
        <li>Restore services and systems that were affected during the attack.</li>
        <li>Conduct security awareness training for employees based on lessons learned from the incident.</li>
    </ul><br>
